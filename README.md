Fourth assignment

"Review of standardized test scores from schools across the district reveals three strong trends:
1) Large schools scored noticeably lower on standardized tests than did schools small and medium schools with 2000 or fewer students. 
Medium schools with student populations of 1000 to 2000 outperformed smaller schools by slight but insignificant margins. 
2) Students in charter schools performed much higher on average than did students in district public schools. 
More analysis is needed to make a final determination on whether this is due to school structure or school size,
as all of the district public schools were classified as large,
while many of the charter schools fell into the small and medium size categories. 
However, comparison between the charter school in the large school category and 
the public schools in the same bracket still shows notably better outcomes for the students at the charter school; 
hence, preliminary analysis would point to school structure as the differentiating feature. 
3) Greater per-student spending did not yield higher test scores.  
On the contrary, schools with smaller per-student budgets consistantly outperformed higher spending schools. 
It is worth noting that the smaller budgets also coincide with smaller and charter schools,
suggesting that limiting school size and encouraging charters may lead to the best outcomes for students."
